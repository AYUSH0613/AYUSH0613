## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Ayush Gupta**, a dedicated programmer with a deep passion for **problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms**. My primary focus lies in **competitive programming**, where I’ve solved over **350+ problems** on LeetCode and earned consistent badges and rankings across contests.

My core strength lies in **logical thinking**, **algorithmic design**, and breaking down complex problems into clean, efficient solutions. I thrive in environments that challenge my ability to think critically and code precisely.

While my heart lies in programming, I also bring **development experience** by building real-world projects using technologies like **Java, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB**. Additionally, I explore **data analysis** using tools such as **R, Tableau, and Excel**, applying statistical insights to practical problems—like customer segmentation and inventory management.

Whether it's optimizing algorithms or building scalable back-end systems, I’m always excited to learn, build, and solve.
